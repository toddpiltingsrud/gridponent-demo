        <h4>Events</h4>

        <p>
            These are not strictly events, they're delegates. Each event can have multiple delegates.
            By not using events, we can simplify the function signature of the delegate.
            To handle one of these, call the corresponding event with a function:
            <br />
            gridponent('#grid1').beforeInit(function(model){ ... });
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>beforeInit - Called once before the grid is completely initialized.</li>
            <li>ready - Called after a grid is comletely initialized.</li>
            <li>rowSelected - Called when a table row is clicked.</li>
            <li>beforeRead - Called before every read operation from the data layer.</li>
            <li>onRead - Called after a read operation completes.</li>
            <li>beforeEdit - When an edit operation is about to begin, this is called before showing the edit UI interface.</li>
            <li>editReady - Called after the edit interface is disaplayed.</li>
            <li>onEdit - Called after an edit operation completes regardless of whether it succeeded.</li>
            <li>httpError - Called whenever an http error occurs.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
